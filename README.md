## My process
I wrote html watching the design files provided trying to estimate how to divide elements for using flexboxes efficiently.
Then I wrote CSS thinking only about colors, backgrounds, font-sizes and elements positions using flexboxes.
At the end I completed the CSS part with paddings, margins, borders etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - This helped me on starting with a clean css structure.
